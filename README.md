# go-api

This will be a simple API written in Golang. Mostly just trying to learn golang a little bit and do something fun.

Not sure what the direction of this api will be. starting simple with a /api/healthcheck at frist and growing from there.

The plan is to also use sqlite and deploy to AWS ECS.


Lets get started.

we are going to use GIN as our http client package?
